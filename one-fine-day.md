Summary: I am editing the blog contents on my terminal for new Xoxzo blog

I am happy to write that** I am on terminal to write a blog,** *feeling as if I am a programmer.*

As said in the Jira ticket ET-41,
> Clone this blog to your local machine using git
I have cloned the repository ofered to clone.

1. I have opened terminal on my machine, moved to the directory of **XoxzoBlog**2. I then wrote *git clone https://github.com/xoxzo/blog.xoxzo.com (the link given in the ticket* hit return.
3. I then hit *ls* to see the repository was cloned.

*As I am not used to use machines in this way, I am a bit nervous, I hope what I am doing is right...*

It is a bit late at night so I just stop writing here.
I would like to continue on the next contents addition with inserting some images.

* ** to be continued... ** *
